### How to start

1. Transformers
   - [An Introduction to Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10557) by Turner is perhaps the best way to start with attention, it is simple, to the point and gives you the "shape" of each array, which is helpful at first.
   - After Turner's paper, I would read [A survey of transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04554). There are typos but I found that this paper was helpful in giving a general overview: each paper implements them slightly differently and that made it very confusing for me. 
   - You will likely still be confused after this paper, so I would recommend [Formal Algorithm for Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09238).
   - I would then watch various of Andrey Karpathy's videos to consolidate understanding such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=485s).
